Phase 1: Initialization
for each service point:
Initialize service point state
end for

Phase 2: Simulation
while simulation time < max_simulation_time:

    Step 1: Update simulation time
    Increment simulation time by a small time step

    Step 2: Process events at service points
    for each service point:
        Process events (e.g., customer arrivals, service completions)
    end for
    
    Step 3: Update service point states
    for each service point:
        Update service point state (e.g., queue length, resource availability)
    end for
    
    Step 4: Execute actions based on simulation logic
    Execute simulation logic (e.g., customer routing, resource allocation)
    
    Step 5: Output simulation metrics or results
    Output simulation metrics or results (e.g., performance measures, visualizations)

end while

Phase 3: Cleanup and analysis
Perform cleanup
Analyze simulation results 

End simulation
